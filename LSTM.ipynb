    "2. Train the model.\n",
    "3. Backtesting to evaluate model's performance on test data. The test time window is determined as from 15-11-2023 to 08.01.2024 ( 1 day before the first GDL strike)\n",
    "4. Run the model to find the prediction at the time window where the strike were on effect ( 10-01-2024 to 15-03-2024)\n",
    "5. Calculate the mean difference and the mean percentage difference between the real observation and the 'predicted value' aka the business as usual values."
